          <h2>A Need for (Less) Speed</h2>
          At the Spaceport America Cup, the world's largest collegiate rocketry competition, competitors are awarded points based on how close their rocket comes to its altitude target. Most teams attempt this challenge by balancing their thrust and mass until one the available rocket flight simulators predicts they'll wind up close to their target. However, real world variability in launch conditions and rocket characteristics put a ceiling on the accuracy of that approach.

          A growing cohort of teams are implementing active drag control, intentionally overshooting their alitude target in simulations so they can deploy airbrakes during flight that bleed off speed until the rocket is on course to hit its mark. One of my tasks this year for Duke Aero, Duke University's High Power Rocketry team, was to develop such a system, one that would take our rocket, on course for 11,000 feet in simulation, and deliver it precisely to its 10,000ft target.

        <h2>20 Seconds to Apogee</h2>
        <p>The mechanical system, no matter how bulletproof, is only as good as the control system that runs it. This is bad news. Put mildly, this is a difficult control systems problem. <br><br> The airbrakes can only provide so much braking force, and that amount decreases throughout flight with the dynamic pressure, so it's pretty easy to wind up in a situation where even with the brakes fully extended you can't make your target. Additionally, the airbrakes can only remove energy from the system, they can't ever speed the rocket back up if it has slowed too much. So it's equally easy to put the rocket in a state where even with the airbrakes fully retracted there isn't enough energy left to make 10k ft.
        <br><br>
        The situation only gets worse when you consider processing power. Using commercial ARM based microcontrollers means that onboard compute is limited, and with only 20 seconds between burnout and apogee every moment is precious. Asking the flight computer to do complex math or even trigenometry is a trade off with the number of updates you can make per second in flight. Anything beyond that (Model Predictive Control, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, etc.) is out of the question.

      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <p>Brainstorming over winter break, I began to develop a method for tackling this problem using a modified version of Explicit Model Predictive Control. The basic idea is this: after burnout, the flight computer takes stock of its speed and altitude and uses those to pick a pre-generated flightplan. This simulation-based flightplan will contain the theoretically "perfect" airbrake deployment setting that should allow the rocket to coast up to 10k feet, but also a list of waypoints for the rocket to aim for on its way up. This way, if the rocket is falling short of the waypoints it can bring the airbrakes in to "catch up," while if it's blowing past all of the waypoints it can extend the airbrakes further to slow things down.
          <br><br>
          This has the advantage of high accuracy from simulation-based planning while asking the flight computer to do very little. Tens of thousands of flight plans covering every set of possible initial conditions can be pre-generated using a more powerful computer and then simply accessed from memory during the flight. Additionally, as the waypoints are generated assuming the rocket has some amount of airbrake deployment, retraction allows the rocket to "virtually" accelerate towards the waypoints, making the risk of overshooting less perilous.
          
          <h5>This is super promising, but there's one major problem: the entire control scheme is based on simulations, and no commercially available rocketry simulator even allows airbrakes simulations, let alone the kind of advanced recursive flight planning required here. To pursue it, you'd have to write your own flight simulator from scratch.</h5>

              Competitors at the Spaceport America Cup are awarded points based on how close their rocket comes to its altitude target. While many teams accomplish this through rigorous simulation and carefully balancing the weight and thrust of the rocket, real world variability in weather and motor performance put a ceiling on the performance of such an approach. A growing cohort of teams are implementing active drag control, intentionally overshooting their alitude target in simulations just to deploy airbrakes during flight that bleed off speed until the rocket is on course to hit its mark. This system is designed to do just that: take a rocket which would otherwise be on course to fly to 11,000 ft and incrementally deploy airbrakes enough to lower the apogee to 10,000ft.
